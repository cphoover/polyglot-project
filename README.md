# qs-project
Just some practice implementing quicksort in as many languages as possible. These are not optimized or thoroughly tested.

These also generally take the first or last index as the pivot point... So will preform worst-case in presorted / almost presorted lists. Ideally we'd use another algo for choosing pivot point.
